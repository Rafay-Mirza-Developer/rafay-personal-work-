    <h1>My Portfolio - Rafay Mirza</h1>
    <font size="4"><p style="text-align: justify;">I am Rafay Mirza, a computer operator with practical experience in handling computer systems, administrative tasks, and office productivity work. My role has allowed me to work efficiently with day to day digital operations and maintain smooth workflow in professional environments.<br><br>

    I have strong knowledge of IT related issues and troubleshooting, and I am capable of identifying and resolving software errors, system faults, and performance problems. I also handle software installation and system configuration, ensuring that computers and workstations remain updated and ready for use.<br><br>

    I am well skilled in MS Office and other computer applications commonly used for administrative and clerical tasks. Whether it is documentation, data entry, reporting, or digital management, I focus on accuracy and reliability to deliver professional results on time. <br><br>

    Along with technical and administrative experience, I also work as a professional typist in English, Urdu, and Sindhi. My typing skills are fast, clean, and well formatted, suitable for business reports, letters, forms, and official communication.<br><br>

    I am also a graphic designer with a creative eye for visual communication. I enjoy designing graphics that are clear, meaningful, and visually appealing. This skill adds value to my technical background and allows me to create digital content that supports communication and branding goals.<br><br>

    I hold a BSc degree, and I am currently learning web development through the PITP program. My aim is to grow as a versatile digital professional who can handle multiple areas including IT support, administration, design, and web development. My portfolio represents my journey and the skills I continue to build.</font>
